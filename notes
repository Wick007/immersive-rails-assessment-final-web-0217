Initially, Stephen rated the interview with Michael J. Fox a 3, but in retrospect, it actually wasn't that bad! As a user, I should be able to edit an appearance so that I can change a rating. Build out the edit functionality for an appearance, keeping with RESTful conventions.

We want to add some more validations to our models - an appearance should only be valid if it has a rating on it that's between 1 and 5.
When we create a new appearance, we should also keep track of the producer who booked that appearance. This means that an appearance should also belong to a user. Update your schema, models, and forms to reflect this.
